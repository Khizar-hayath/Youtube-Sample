# Youtube-Sample
I created this sample YouTube website using HTML and CSS to practice Layouts and some CSS concepts
This project is based on the YouTube tutorial by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc).  
I followed along to build this sample webpage and added a few minor adjustments.
